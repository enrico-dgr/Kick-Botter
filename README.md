## Description

- This is an open source app
- It was born just to be a self-learning project
- Supposed to be used to automate some action on telegram bots like SocialMedia, which pays you (with Amazon Coupons) for some Instagram interaction. *NOTE* : It is intended to be in accordance with the rules that these legal bots place you on (e.g. Instagram profiles' type).

## Development

User interface will be pretty messy for a while, so just tell me what could be useful.  
In my list:

- List of running processes
- Better result logging (there could be problems non-programmer would solve on themselves. E.g. instagram blocks due to excessive number of requests)
- A little bit of styling :sweat_smile:
- Settings' description on mouse-over

## [Last Release](https://github.com/enrico-dgr/Kick-Botter/releases/tag/v1.0.16)

## Usage

:warning: I used it on Mac OS and occasionally try it on Window, so take it for good only on Mac OS.

After downloading and extracted (installed for .dmg), on opening could appear a window with error message about 'initUpdate'. This should be a temporary error due on configurations on my side, but app should work just fine.

**Steps :**
The GUI, though bad, should be pretty clear:

- select user
- select the program
- click `run`

**For first user's run :**  
Select 'OpenBrowser' to open a browser associated to selected user and login on socials (the ones you will use through programs).

**Notice :**  
You won't have much feedback from programs right now.
They can run both headless (non visible) and non-headless (visible/usual browser) and should close the browser on controlled *end of activity*. If something occurs on front-end, you might not notice program didn't run.
If this is the case, you must restart app in order to use that user.
