## Description

- This is an open source app
- It was born exclusively as a self-learning project
- It is supposed to be used to automate some actions on telegram bots like SocialMedia, which pays you (with Amazon Coupons) for Instagram interactions. *NOTE* : It is intended to be in accordance with the rules that these legal bots place you on (e.g. Instagram profiles' type).

## Development

User interface will be pretty messy for a while, so just tell me what could be useful.  
In my list:

- List of running processes
- Better result logging (there could be problems non-programmers would solve by themselves. E.g. instagram blocks due to excessive number of requests)
- A little bit of styling :sweat_smile:
- Settings' description on mouse-over

## [Last Release](https://github.com/enrico-dgr/Kick-Botter/releases/latest)

## Usage

**Steps :**
Although bad, the GUI should be pretty clear:

- select user
- select the program
- click `run`

**For first user's run :**  
Select 'OpenBrowser' to open a browser associated to the selected user and login on socials (the ones you will use through the programs).

**Notice :**  
You won't have much feedback from the programs right now.
They can run both headless (non visible) and non-headless (visible/usual browser).
