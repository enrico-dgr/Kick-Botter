## Description

- This is an open source app
- It was born exclusively as a self-learning project
- It is supposed to be used to automate some actions on telegram bots like SocialMedia, which pays you (with Amazon Coupons) for Instagram interactions. *NOTE* : It is intended to be in accordance with the rules that these legal bots place you on (e.g. Instagram profiles' type).

## [Last Release](https://github.com/enrico-dgr/Kick-Botter/releases/latest)

## Usage

**Steps :**

- select user
- select the program
- click `run`

**For first user's run :**  
Select 'OpenBrowser' to open a browser associated to the selected user and login on socials (the ones you will use through the programs).

**Example**:  
The program *Socialgift* uses Telegram and Instagram. Once you added a user, you must run *OpenBrowser* and login on TG and IG. Then you can close *OpenBrowser* and run *Socialgift* (with that same user of *OpenBrowser*).

**Notice :**  
You won't have much feedback from the programs right now.
They can run both headless (non visible) and non-headless (visible/usual browser).
